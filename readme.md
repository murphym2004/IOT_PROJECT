In the last 10 years there has over 10,000 robbery offences, leading to a lot of theft. This alarming threat leads people/family’s to be afraid to leave their home unattended. while theft cannot be eliminated it can be reduced by not having as easy of an opening to commit a crime one of the solutions would be the implementation of my IOT smart gate.
The smart gate is an automated gate advanced security system designed to limit unauthorized access to private properties. It utilizes cutting-edge technology to enhance safety and deter criminal activity. Here’s how it works:
access control: the gate can only be opened by using the following:
RFID scanner
pir-sensor
button for servo in website
any unknown individuals or unauthorized personnel will be denied entry ensuring only those with proper credentials can access the property
this will allow homeowners to feel more at ease knowing their homes are secure while away. This solution helps restore a sense of safety for families and home afraid of theft while bringing benefits such as seamless automation making entry and exit more efficient for those who are authorized
